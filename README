to compile this program, type 

	javac *.java 

With that done, run the program by typing java prefixMatcher <dictionary>, where the single 
argument is the name of a dictionary file consiting of n words, one word per line. We have 
included the file Dictionary.txt for this purpose. This dictionary file contains ~250k words 
randomized from the linux file /usr/share/dict/words, and it may take up to a minute to load completely.

the simplest command line, then, is 
	
	java PrefixMatcher dictionary.txt
